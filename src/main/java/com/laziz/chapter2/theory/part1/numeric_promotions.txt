Numeric Promotion Rules:

1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the LARGER of the two
    data types.
2. If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the
    integral value to the floating-point value's data type.
3. Smaller data types, namely, byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time they are used with a
    Java binary arithmetic operator with a variable (as opposed to a value), even if neither of the operants is int.
4. After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have
    the same data type as its promoted operands
