Creating Dates and Times:

- LocalDate     Contains just a date—no time and no time zone. A good example of LocalDate is your birthday this year.
    It is your birthday for a full day, regardless of what time it is.

- LocalTime     Contains just a time—no date and no time zone. A good example of LocalTime is midnight.
    It is midnight at the same time every day.

- LocalDateTime     Contains both a date and time but no time zone. A good example of LocalDateTime is
    “the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve.” Midnight on January 2 isn’t nearly as special,
    making the date relatively unimportant, and clearly an hour after midnight isn’t as special either.

- ZonedDateTime     Contains a date, time, and time zone. A good example of ZonedDateTime is
    “a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EST.” If you live in California, you’ll have to get up really early
    since the call is at 6:00 a.m. local time!



You obtain date and time instances using a static method:
- System.out.println(LocalDate.now());      // 2021–10–25
- System.out.println(LocalTime.now());      // 09:13:07.768
- System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now());  // 2021–10–25T09:13:07.768
- System.out.println(ZonedDateTime.now());  // 2021–10–25T09:13:07.769–05:00[America/New_York]


- var date1 = LocalDate.of(2022, Month.JANUARY, 20);
- var date2 = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 20);

For months in the new date and time methods, Java counts starting from 1, just as we humans do. These two examples
    are the same values


var time1 = LocalTime.of(6, 15);                // hour and minute
var time2 = LocalTime.of(6, 15, 30);            // + seconds
var time3 = LocalTime.of(6, 15, 30, 200);       // + nanoseconds


You can combine dates and times into one object:

- var dateTime1 = LocalDateTime.of(2022, Month.JANUARY, 20, 6, 15, 30);
- var dateTime2 = LocalDateTime.of(date1, time2);


There are many methods to create LocalDateTime, such as:

- public static LocalDateTime of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute, int second)
- public static LocalDateTime of(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute, int second

- public static LocalDateTime of(LocalDate date, LocalTime time)


ZonedDateTime:

- var zone = ZoneId.of("US/Eastern");
- var zoned1 = ZonedDateTime.of(2022, 1, 20, 6, 15, 30, 200, zone);
- var zoned2 = ZonedDateTime.of(date1, time2, zone);
- var zoned3 = ZonedDateTime.of(dateTime1, zone);


The classes discussed have private constructors, and provide factory methods to create instances.

var d = new LocalDate(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
