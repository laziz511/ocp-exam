- The strip() method does everything that trim() does, but it supports Unicode.

- The stripLeading() method removes whitespace from the beginning of the String and leaves it at the end

- The stripTrailing() method does the opposite.


The method signatures are as follows:

public String strip()
public String stripLeading()
public String stripTrailing()
public String trim()


System.out.println("\t a b c\n".strip()); // a b c
