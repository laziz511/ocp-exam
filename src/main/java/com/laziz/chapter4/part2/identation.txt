Working with Indentation:

- public String indent(int numberSpaces)
- public String stripIndent()

The indent() method adds the same number of blank spaces to the beginning of each line if you pass a positive number.
If you pass a negative number, it tries to remove that number of whitespace characters from the beginning of the line.
If you pass zero, the indentation will not change.

NOTE: If you call indent() with a negative number and try to remove more whitespace characters than are present
at the beginning of the line, Java will remove all that it can find.


The stripIndent() method gets rid of all incidental whitespace. This means that all non-blank lines are shifted left
so the same number of whitespace characters are removed from each line and the first character that remains is not blank.
