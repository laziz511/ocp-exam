1. Inferring the Type with var:
- type inference, which is using var instead of variable type, is only allowed for local variables

2. Be on the lookout for var used with constructors,
    method parameters, or instance variables.
Using var in one of these places is a good exam trick to see if you are paying attention.
Remember that var is only used for local variable type inference!

3. Thereâ€™s one last rule you should be aware of:
    - var is not a reserved word and allowed to be used as an identifier. It is considered a reserved type name.
      A reserved type name means it cannot be used to define a type, such as a class, interface, or enum.

4. Out of the blue, this code does compile:

public class Var {
    public void var() {
        var var = "var";
    }
    public void Var() {
        Var var = new Var();
    }
}

- Java is case sensitive, so Var does not introduce any conflicts as a class name.
- Naming a local variable var is legal
