Identifying Identifiers

- identifiers must begin with a letter, a currency symbol, or a _ symbol.
        Currency symbols include dollar ($), yuan (¥), euro (€), and so on.

- identifiers can include numbers but not start with them

- a single underscore _ is not allowed as an identifier

- the same name as the Java reserved words cannot be used as identifiers


if the number was allowed to be used as identifier, how the program should decide which value to use in the following:

int 5 = 5555;
int myValue = 5;

here, in this case, should the program set 5 to a variable myValue, or should it take 5555 from variable 5 and set it.

similar problem, why multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java
