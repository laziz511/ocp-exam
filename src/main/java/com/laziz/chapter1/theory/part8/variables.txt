Instance and class variables do not require you to initialize them.
As soon as you declare these variables, they are given a default value.

The compiler does not know what value to use and so wants the simplest value it can give the type:
    - null for an object,
    - zero for the numeric types,
    - false for a boolean,
    - '\u0000' (NUL) for a char.
