Question: Suppose you have a module named com.vet.
Where could you place the following module-info.java file to create a valid module?

public module com.vet {
    exports com.vet;
}

Answer:  Option D. If this were a valid module-info.java file, it would need to be placed at the root directory
of the module. However, a module is not allowed to use the public access modifier. The provided file does not compile
regardless of the placement in the project.
